        "A skin disease is a medical condition that affects the skin's appearance, texture, and function. Skin diseases can range from mild conditions, such as acne or a rash, to more serious conditions, such as psoriasis, eczema, or skin cancer. Skin diseases can affect people of all ages, races, and genders. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, exposure to irritants or allergens, infections, hormonal imbalances, and autoimmune disorders.Symptoms of skin diseases can vary widely depending on the specific condition, but may include redness, swelling, itching, dryness, scaling, blistering, or changes in skin color or texture.<br>\n",
        "Proper diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases is crucial for maintaining healthy skin and preventing complications. Early diagnosis is particularly important as it can prevent permanent scarring, disfigurement, and even life-threatening conditions such as skin cancer. Additionally, early diagnosis can help prevent the spread of infectious skin diseases such as bacterial or viral infections. The use of skin disease classification tools can aid in the early and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases, leading to improved outcomes and better overall health for patients.<br>\n",
        "This project aims to develop a skin disease image classifier that can identify skin diseases in images uploaded by users.  The classifier will be integrated into a website where users can upload photos of their skin diseases and receive an accurate diagnosis. The machine learning algorithm used in the  project will utilise a dataset of images scraped from the [DermNet NZ Image Library](https://dermnetnz.org/image-library) and [Mind the Gap: Supporting Black and Brown Skin Health](https://www.blackandbrownskin.co.uk/mindthegap) websites."

        "Skin diseases are common and can have significant impacts on a person's health and quality of life. However, patients may struggle to access dermatological expertise due to various reasons, such as lack of dermatologists in some areas, long wait times for appointments, and high costs associated with consultations, while dermatologists face the challenge of accurately identifying and diagnosing skin diseases quickly. To address these challenges, we propose building an AI-powered skin disease classifier that improves diagnosis accuracy and accessibility for both dermatologists and patients.<br>\n",
        "By leveraging Neural Network techniques and the vast collection of clinical images of skin diseases available on  [DermNet NZ Image Library](https://dermnetnz.org/image-library) and [Mind the Gap: Supporting Black and Brown Skin Health](https://www.blackandbrownskin.co.uk/mindthegap), we can build a skin disease classifier that accurately identifies and classifies skin diseases in a matter of seconds. This can aid dermatologists in their clinical decision-making process and reduce the time it takes to diagnose skin diseases, leading to better patient outcomes. Furthermore, patients can use the classifier to self-diagnose their skin diseases and seek medical attention if needed, thus increasing accessibility and affordability of dermatological care. Ultimately, our goal is to improve the diagnosis and management of skin diseases, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs."

        "The success criteria is to achieve high precision in classifying skin diseases, indicating that the classifier correctly identifies the disease type and minimizes the number of false positives. Precision is a measure of how accurate the classifier is when it predicts a positive result. It represents the number of true positive classifications divided by the total number of positive classifications made by the classifier (i.e., true positives plus false positives). A high precision score indicates that the classifier is good at avoiding false positive classifications, which is important in the case of skin disease classification, as misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments or interventions.<br>\n",
        "However, precision alone may not be sufficient, and other metrics such as F1 score and accuracy will be considered to ensure the classifier's overall performance is optimal."
